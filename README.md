# Portfolio
Made with React and Tailwind, this portfolio exists with the intention of showing off recently learned effects, while tastefully and skillfully presenting my work. I decided to remake my portfolio, because I felt that previous iterations fell short in two ways:
The overall layout/experience and the way content in general in displayed.
The obtuse way the projects themselves were displayed.

With this iteration I wanted to keep the layout relatively simple, while incorporating some eye-catching accents. With each section having its own accent(s), I tried to keep the accents unique, while maintaining aesthetic congruence throughout.

By far, my favorite aspect is swiping the tilting, glassmorphic cards. I find the effect super satisfying to interact with.
